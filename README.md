### Organizing Dashboard SQL

This repository contains example SQL queries used to power internal dashboards. The code is provided as a reference for query structure, data transformations, and scheduling patterns—not for direct execution without modification.

#### Project Overview

These queries demonstrate:

Building views for reporting and QA

Scheduling queries to update derived tables

Organizing transformations for visualization dashboards

Note: All project IDs, dataset names, and table names in this repo are placeholders. Replace them with your own environment’s identifiers before running.
``` SQL
Example Query Pattern
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `{{project_id}}.{{dataset}}.example_view` AS
SELECT
  id,
  event_name,
  COUNT(*) AS total
FROM `{{project_id}}.{{dataset}}.raw_events`
WHERE status = 'Completed'
GROUP BY 1, 2;

Usage Notes

These examples are designed for columnar data warehouses (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift).

Replace {{project_id}}, {{dataset}}, and {{table}} with your own values.
```
Queries are written to be modular and human-readable for team dashboards.

#### Scheduling

Queries can be scheduled to run periodically (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly) depending on your data refresh needs. Costs will vary based on your dataset size—monitor usage within your own billing environment.

#### Contact

For issues, please open a GitHub Issue in this repository.

#### Contributing

Contributions are welcome! When submitting changes:

Parameterize any project- or org-specific values.

Ensure queries are generic and runnable by others with placeholder replacements.
